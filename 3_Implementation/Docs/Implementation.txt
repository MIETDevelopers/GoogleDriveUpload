* To set up the code in your machine using xampp server only the following steps needed to be followed:
- Download or clone the code from the repository.
- Save the extracted zip file in the path C:/xampp/htdocs(if you are using xampp you can rename the folder to googledrive).
- Before using the code you need to start the xampp apache and mySQL server.
- Now when you will run it by using URL as localhost/googledrive(in my case) 40X Error will be displayed. This is because we hadn't enabled any of our Google Drive API.

* To enable Google Drive API follow the steps as:
- Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis.
